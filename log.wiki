TODO:

* [X] Hide the "minutes" from the slides
* [X] Hide the "minutes" from handout of learning goals + plans
* [X] For the set of four games with simple payoffs:
      1. Payoff matrices on slides, one game a time.
      2. (Re)-Name the strategies verbally ==> to make them meaningful;
      3. Plan:
         a) Split 12 people into 2 groups;
         b) Give unspecified opponent strategies (don't pair people into groups
            of twos)
         c) Draw the demo of the games on the board, and keep recording people's
            choice in their role.
         d) Rise hands and document on board, for each game.
      * Goal here: to demonstrate the types of games and how they fit into
        strategic situations.
* [X] Enhance the concept of "iterated deletion" as a method:
      1. Revisit Prison Dilemma result, and motivate the idea of iterated
         deletion
      2. Demonstrate the long game with 4*4 matrix, through applying the method
         of iterated deletion of dominated strategies.
      3. Introduce the coordination game (game of sex, for example), where
         multiple equilibria co-exists.
         * ==> To motivate the idea of Nash equilibrium after the break.
* [ ] 7-equilibria game: need to take slides from Tanya on *description of the
      game*.
      * [ ] Pending from Tanya
* [ ] Prepare practice examples (for calculation), as backup plans.
* [X] Comment on what has been missing in the theoretical context of Game
      Theory:
      1. How unrealistic they are!
         1) simultaneous move game is not valid upon communication;
      2. Yet, there are more forms of games available:
         * repeated game,
         * sequential games
         * etc.
* [X] Schelling's piece: discussion questions
      1. How would communication affect the structure of the game?
      2. How would the number of equilibria affect strategic decision making?
         Any other way of eliminating possible confusions?
            (For example: credible through will reinforce a unilateral strategy)
      3. etc
